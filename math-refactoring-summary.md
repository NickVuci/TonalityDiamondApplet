# Math Module Refactoring - Complete

## Changes Made

1. **Created Dedicated Math Module**
   - Extracted all math-related functionality to `modules/math.js`
   - Added proper module exports for all math functions
   - Added documentation comments for better code readability

2. **Updated Main Application Structure**
   - Modified `index.js` to import math module alongside audio module
   - Removed duplicate math functions from the main file
   - Updated references to use the imported math functions

3. **Enhanced Code Organization**
   - All mathematical utilities are now in a single, dedicated file
   - Each function is properly documented with JSDoc comments
   - Code is more maintainable and easier to understand

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - All math-related code is now in a single, dedicated file
   - Clear separation between mathematical utilities and application logic

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Math code can now be modified independently
   - Clearer interface between math utilities and the rest of the application
   - Easier to test mathematical functions in isolation

3. **Enhanced Readability**
   - Added documentation to all math functions
   - Cleaner structure makes logic easier to follow

## Functions in Math Module

The math module now contains these utility functions:

- `gcd`: Calculate greatest common divisor
- `primesUpTo`: Generate primes up to a limit
- `factorAllowed`: Check if a number contains only allowed prime factors
- `normalizeFloat`: Normalize a float to first octave [1,2)
- `normalizeFrac`: Normalize a fraction to first octave
- `largestPrimeFactor`: Find the largest prime factor of a number
- `oddset`: Generate odd numbers up to a limit
- `limitset`: Generate a limit set with optional prime filtering
- `parseCustom`: Parse custom number input
- `clamp`: Clamp a value between min and max

## Next Steps

According to the refactoring plan, the next module to extract would be the visualization module, which handles color mapping and visual representation.
