# Audio Module Refactoring - Complete

## Changes Made

1. **Created Dedicated Audio Module**
   - Extracted all audio-related functionality to `modules/audio.js`
   - Added proper module exports for all audio functions
   - Added documentation comments for better code readability

2. **Updated Main Application Structure**
   - Modified `index.js` to use dynamic ES module imports
   - Added module initialization flow
   - Refactored to use imported audio functions

3. **Updated HTML**
   - Added `type="module"` attribute to script tag to enable ES modules

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - All audio-related code is now in a single, dedicated file
   - Clear separation between audio functionality and grid/UI logic

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Audio code can now be modified independently
   - Clearer interface between audio and the rest of the application

3. **Enhanced Readability**
   - Added documentation to audio functions
   - Cleaner structure makes logic easier to follow

## Next Steps

According to the refactoring plan, the next module to extract would be the mathematical utilities (`math.js`), which has the lowest complexity and fewest dependencies.

Would you like to proceed with the math module extraction next?
